# Wave Studio

Develop Wave apps directly from your browser - zero installation needed! Supported features:

* Wave apps/scripts.
* Autocomplete.
* Export/import apps.
* Multiple views (code, preview, split).
* Logs.

## Notice

The app listens on `/studio` route. As of time of writing, Appstore does not support opening instance url other then root (`/`) which means you need to manually append `/studio` to the instance URL yourself. Sorry for the inconvenience!
